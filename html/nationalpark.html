        Bandhavgarh National Park is spread over the Vindhya hills in Madhya Pradesh. <br>The national park consists of a core area of 105 sq km and a buffer area of <br>approximately 400 sq km. The topography of the whole area varies between steep <br>ridges, undulating forest and open meadows. Bandhavgarh National Park is known for <br>the Royal Bengal Tigers. The density of the tiger population at Bandhavgarh is the <br>highest known in India as well as in the world. The national park was the former <br>hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Rewa and at present is a famous natural hub for <br>White Tigers. White Tigers, now a major attraction around the worldâ€™s zoos, were <br>first discovered in Rewa, not far from here. It is also believed that all the white <br> tigers across the globe trace their roots to Bandhavgarh. The terrain is broken, with <br>rocky hill ranges, running roughly east and west, interspersed with grassy swamps <br>and forested valleys.  <br> <br>
